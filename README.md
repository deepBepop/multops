#   This code is meant to simulate and demonstrate the Multops Data structure.

#   We have defined two classes, (i) The Multops Data Structure itself, (ii) a class MultopsTree representing a node of the Multops tree as described in the research paper proposed at USENIX 2001.

#   In the real world when Multops is implemented, it will be called by the router when handling a packet.
#   Multops has only two interfaces which the router will utilizes.
#   Thus we have created two methods in the Multops class Forward_Packets_Interface, and Forward_Packets_Interface which we will use to demonstrate the Multops data structure.

#   We highly recommend going to the driver code first and commenting out each section to see how Multops is performing.
